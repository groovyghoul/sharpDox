				<p>Building code documentation with <strong>sharpDox</strong> is really easy. Just download it, 
extract the zip file to any location and start the <em>SharpDox.Core.exe</em>. </p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/sdi.en.startSD.png" alt="Shell" /></p>

<p>Developers are able to create additional shells for <strong>sharpDox</strong>. If more than one shell 
is available in the folder <em>shells</em>, <strong>sharpdox</strong> will ask which one should get started. 
If you only need one shell please delete the other ones. </p>

<p>To create your first documentation it is suggested to start the GUI of <strong>sharpDox</strong>. 
The GUI helps you to create a config for your documentation. Exporters are able to provide 
additional settings which are available as additional categories.</p>

<p>Developers are able to create different output formats for the code documentation. 
Besides the chm documentation, which is delivered together with <strong>sharpDox</strong>, it is possible to create additional exporters as plugins. You only have to download/develop 
the exporter and drop it into the <em>plugin</em> folder of <strong>sharpDox</strong>. The new exporter will 
be registered during a restart of <strong>sharpDox</strong> and gets executed during the build process (find <a href="../article/Create_a_exporter.html">here</a> a tutorial to create an own exporter).</p>

<p>If you provided all needed settings, the documentation is ready to build. Press <em>Build</em> to start the build process. After the successful build your documentation is located 
in the given output path. <strong>sharpDox</strong> creates a subfolder for each registered exporter.</p>

<p>Have fun with <strong>sharpDox</strong>!</p>
